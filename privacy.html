                <p>It is Regraph Co's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Regraph Co collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Regraph Co's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Regraph Co's visitors use its website. From time to time, Regraph Co may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Regraph Co also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Regraph Co only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Logged in visitors to Regraph Co's website interact with Regraph Co in ways that require Regraph Co to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Regraph Co gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, when you sign in to Regraph Co with your existing account on another website, Regraph Co may gather certain profile data for that account. When you create a database on Regraph Co, the database, and the data in it, is associated with the account under which you are logged in. In each case, Regraph Co collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Regraph Co. Regraph Co does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics
Regraph Co may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Regraph Co may monitor the popularity of various features of the application. Regraph Co may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Regraph Co does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Regraph Co discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Regraph Co's behalf or to provide services available at Regraph Co's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Regraph Co's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Regraph Co will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Regraph Co discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Regraph Co believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Regraph Co, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request via one of our feedback mechanisms, we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Regraph Co takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Regraph Co uses cookies to help Regraph Co identify and track visitors, their usage of Regraph Co website, and their website access preferences. Regraph Co visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Regraph Co's website, with the drawback that certain features of Regraph Co's website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Business Transfers
If Regraph Co, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Regraph Co goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Regraph Co may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Regraph Co may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Regraph Co's sole discretion. It is your responsibility to check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
