If you create, edit, or share a database, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, "Content"), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:
                the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
                if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
                you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
                the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
                the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);

                your databases are not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;
                you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Regraph Co or otherwise.
                If you delete Content, Regraph Co will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

                Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Regraph Co has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Regraph Co's sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Regraph Co's reasonable opinion, violates any Regraph Co policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in Regraph Co's sole discretion. Regraph Co will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

                Payment and Renewal.
                General Terms.
                Optional paid services are available on the Website (any such services, an "Upgrade"). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Regraph Co the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. Upgrade fees are not refundable.

                Automatic Renewal.
                Unless you notify Regraph Co before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Account Settings page.

                Responsibility of Website Visitors. Regraph Co has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Website, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material's content, use or effects. By operating the Website, Regraph Co does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. Regraph Co disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Website, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.
                Content Posted on Other Websites. We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which Regraph Co links, and that link to Regraph Co. Regraph Co does not have any control over those non-Regraph Co websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Regraph Co website or webpage, Regraph Co does not represent or imply that it endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Regraph Co disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-Regraph Co websites and webpages.
                Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy. As Regraph Co asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by Regraph Co violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify Regraph Co in accordance with Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Regraph Co will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. Regraph Co will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Regraph Co or others. In the case of such termination, Regraph Co will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Regraph Co.
                Intellectual Property. This Agreement does not transfer from Regraph Co to you any Regraph Co or third party intellectual property, and all right, title and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Regraph Co. Regraph Co, the Regraph Co logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with Regraph Co, or the Website are trademarks or registered trademarks of Regraph Co or Regraph Co's licensors.

                Termination. Regraph Co may terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.

Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in New York City, New York, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Regraph Co may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
